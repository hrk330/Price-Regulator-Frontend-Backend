## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

1. **Admin** uploads regulated products with government prices
2. **System** automatically scrapes ecommerce sites (Celery jobs)
3. **System** compares scraped prices with regulations → creates violations
4. **Investigator** reviews violations → confirms/dismisses → creates cases
5. **Investigator** manages cases through investigation workflow
6. **Regulator** monitors compliance through dashboards and exports reports
